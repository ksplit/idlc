## Peg Syntax

- Nonterminals that can take in values are preceded by an identifier
keyword, for example, 
```
unnamed_scope 	= 	s:unnamed_scope_special new_chans:ChanInits* ch:Channel_scope* d:Type_Definitions* r:Rpc* Spacing CLOSEC Spacing {{ 
```
These identifer keywords are declared as `Value` variables in the parser that is generated by vembyr, `lcd_idl.cpp`. In this parser, the corresponding values of the nonterminal obtained from the input (the .idl file) is stored in these variables, as shown below
```
new_chans = result_peg_3.getValues();
```

## Parser code generation

When a certain rule matches the input, parser code is generated. Let's take a look at the code generated for the rule:
```
Interface       =         m:Interface_special Space+ id:Identifier Spacing OPEN chans:Channels Spacing CLOSE Spacing OPENC Spacing new_chans:ChanInits* ch:Channel_scope* d:Type_Definitions* r:Rpc* r2:unnamed_scope* Spacing CLOSEC Spacing
```
An `Interface` in the idl entails the creation of a new scope. Hence we create a new lexical scope, by using the value provided for the `Interface_special` non-terminal, captured in identifer `m` (as shown in the grammar.):
```
LexicalScope *module_scope = (LexicalScope*) m.getValue();
```


## Nonterminal Dependencies

Here we show dependencies of nonterminal symbols
based on the current peg grammar. Tags are added in the dependency 
tree the meanings of which are described below: 

- To see all the dependencies of a specific nonterminal, look at the entry of that nonterminal, where its name ends with a `*define`, e.g. `Include*define`. 
- If a nonterminal symbol ends with `*none`, it depends on no other nonterminal symbols. In other words, it expands to terminal symbols when its grammar rule is used.
- If a nonterminal symbol ends with `*derived`, it has already been derived in this file.
- If a nonterminal symbol does not end with anything, it is yet to be defined in this file.

- Meanwhile, this can be useful to find out the rule for a specific non terminal. 

```
grep -n "Space.*=" lcd_idl.peg 
```

[TODO] It would be great if this dependency tree can be automatically generated.
