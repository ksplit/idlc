"module" is not a module
require mod_a, mod_b; essentially forms an "implicit" module, that behaves like both mod_a and mod_b
ftlog, modify the syntax to be saner
module (mod_a, mod_b, mod_c) {

}

Drivers *never* export, only require
Only the kernel exports

No need to support require chains, only require "merging", as mentioned
