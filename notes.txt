ah461	Tue, Sep 18, 18	#	1	All visits are implemented| how are the registers used?, why are they needed	
ah462			2	marshalling implemented here	
				interface.cpp in code gen folder contributes to generating output for callee code (tested for fail1)	
ah463		#	3	The visit for projection is apparently doing nothing. Should it?	
ah464		#	4	when is the params list for marshalling populated?	
ah465	Wed, Sep 19, 18	#	5	this is in the caller_interface init function, so why is "cap_init" being output in nullnet_callee.c?	
				code_gen/utils.cpp contains the implementations of the functions actually generating the various expressions in the code output	
				vector pushback| used for storing variable names in vectors of type string	http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/push_back/
				string_utils.cpp contains the implementation of constructing variable and function names	
ah466			6	Project class - it is a class that represents the encompassing project of all of the output files created by the idl compiler - Project is conceptually the tree that is first generated after parsing the file see [8]	
				include/lst_ast.h contains the defintions of all the constructs that should be present in the output program	
ah467			7	this is where the files are generated	
				include/ccst.h contains the definition for the C AST. This is how the C AST is generated: 1. IDL -> IR 2. transforming the tree and gettting a C AST of the output	
ah468			8	where the input idl is parsed
